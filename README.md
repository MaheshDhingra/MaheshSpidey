# 🕸️ GitHub Trending Scraper

A Python web scraper that fetches GitHub's trending repositories daily, respects `robots.txt`, and saves the data in a structured directory for analysis or public use.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Track trending repositories on GitHub daily and store them in structured JSON files for further analysis or open data sharing.

---

## ⚙️ Setup

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/github-trending-scraper.git
cd github-trending-scraper

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

### Run scraper once:

```bash
python scraper/github_scraper.py --today-only
```

### Print today's top trending repo:

```bash
python scraper/github_scraper.py --top
```

### Run scraper with daily scheduling (runs scraping at 10:00 AM daily):

```bash
python scraper/github_scraper.py
```

> *Note:* The scheduled run will keep the process running and scrape daily at 10:00 AM.

## 🔒 Ethical Considerations

* Respects `robots.txt` before crawling
* Uses a custom, identifiable User-Agent header
* Handles errors and logs events for transparency

---

## 📦 Additional Tools

* **`track_repo_growth.py`** — Tracks star growth for each repo over time
* **`upload_to_kaggle.py`** — Automates uploading daily datasets to Kaggle
* **`daily_run.py`** — Runs the scraper, tracker, and Kaggle uploader in sequence

---

## 💡 Future Improvements

* Add notifications for trending repo changes
* Support scraping multiple GitHub trending languages or timeframes
* Integrate with dashboards or visualization tools
